  caption: "Discussed in this course are pluripotent stem cells, which are undifferentiated\
    \ cells that maintain the capability to give rise to any cell type. These Induced\
    \ Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) are adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed\
    \ to an embryonic stem cell\u2013like state, and the different colors indicate\
    \ different genetic markers being expressed by the cells. Image by Sabrina Heman-Ackah,\
